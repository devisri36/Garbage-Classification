    Garbage Classification using Transfer Learning
This project uses deep learning to classify garbage images into six categories: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash.
It leverages transfer learning with EfficientNetV2B2 for accurate and efficient classification.

Features
- Image classification into six garbage types

- Web application built with Streamlit

- User-friendly interface to upload and classify images

- Displays predicted category and confidence score

Tools & Technologies
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras

- EfficientNetV2B2 (pre-trained on ImageNet)

- Streamlit for the web app

- PIL and NumPy for image processing

Conclusion
- This project demonstrates how AI and transfer learning can help automatically classify waste materials, supporting better recycling and waste management practices.
